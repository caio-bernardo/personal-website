As you might have notice my name is _Caio Bernardo_, some friends call me _Orimoto_. I'm brazillian, studying Information Systems in the University of São Paulo. I started programming as a hobby during the Covid Pandemic, but it grew into a passion.

Now I'm more interested in the academic research field, I've done researchs in evaluation and monitoring of conversational agents for different usecases. I enjoy software development, infraestructure and application design &mdash; my favorite language is Rust ~~btw~~. In 2025, I started to dive into Game Development with some friends.

This website was created for a lot of reasons:
1. I always wanted to have a website
2. I wanted to centralize all information about me
3. I love writing and thought a blog would motivate me to write more often.
4. Saw lot of content about the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) and decided to participate.

I promise to try the best I can to keep this site on the air and updated.
