As the title says this is my first post, so uhuu... Hello, how are you?... However this also the post that explains the reason this blog even exists. The answer for this question is pretty simple, I always wanted a personal website. First because I'm defensor (at least I try) of an indie, descentralized and communal web^[1], thus I created a digital garden of my own, where I can centralize everything about me and share in other plataforms. The second reason is that I often read and write about things and I thought a blog could help direct this productivity energy to something useful for the society (or maybe just entertain one or two people).

## Why the Kanagawa Wave in the navbar?

I wanted a logo to represent myself and once one of my friends got me a colar picturing the Wave, I love it, so I adopted as my own, just for now. If you don't know the Wave, see the picture below and the [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Wave_off_Kanagawa) about it.

Also the image you see on the nav bar is from [jakeLoris](https://pixabay.com/users/jakeloris-21997059/).

## How this website was built?

I decided to use [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) in combination with [Pico CSS](https://picocss.com/) &mdash; because I hate CSS.

## What I'm gonna see if a subscribe to you?

To be honest, I don't expect to make a post very often, my ideal goal would be a post every month, but with college and other obligations I don't know if its gonna work. Anyway, I'll try to be consistent.

About subjects, I will write about what I like, this includes software development, anime, games and more. You can also send me suggestions, by [email](mailto:me@caiobernardo.top).
