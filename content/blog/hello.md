As the title says this is my first post, so uhhmm... Hello, how are you?... However, this also the post that explains the reason this blog even exists. The answer for this question is pretty simple, I've always wanted a personal website. First because I'm defender (at least I try) of an indie, descentralized and communal internet[^1], thus I created a digital garden of my own, where I can centralize everything about me and share in other plataforms. The second reason is that I often read and write about things and I thought a blog could help direct this productivity energy toward something useful for society (or maybe just entertain one or two people).

## Why the Kanagawa Wave in the navbar?

I wanted a logo to represent myself and once one of my friends got me a colar picturing the Wave, I love it, so I adopted as my own &mdash; at least for for now. If you don't know the Wave, see the picture below and the [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Wave_off_Kanagawa) about it.

Also the image you see on the navbar is from [jakeLoris](https://pixabay.com/users/jakeloris-21997059/).

## How this website was built?

I decided to use [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) in combination with [Pico CSS](https://picocss.com/), because I hate to write CSS and like how Pico's defaults look. I actually manually downloaded the library and adapted it to Zola, since its been broken since v2.1 because of the [grass](https://github.com/connorskees/grass) crate (Yes, it's a rabbit hole).

## What you're going to see if a subscribe to you?

To be honest, I don't expect to make a post very often, my ideal goal would be a post every month, but with college and other obligations I don't know if it going to work. Anyway, I'll try to be consistent.

About subjects, I'll write about what I like, this includes software development, anime, games, philosophy maybe, who knows... Also, I plan to post about projects and presentations. You can also send me suggestions by [email](mailto:me@caiobernardo.top).
